# RockYou2024: 10 Billion Passwords Leaked

The largest password compilation ever, with nearly 10 billion unique passwords, was leaked on a popular hacking forum. This massive leak poses severe dangers to users who reuse passwords.

Researchers discovered the compilation, with 9,948,575,739 unique plaintext passwords, posted on July 4th by forum user ObamaCare. Previous leaks by this user include sensitive databases from Simmons & Simmons and Rowan College.

Analysis revealed these passwords come from old and new data breaches, heightening the risk of credential stuffing attacks. These attacks use stolen passwords to gain unauthorized access, threatening users and businesses.

The RockYou2024 compilation follows the RockYou2021 leak, which had 8.4 billion passwords. Over three years, attackers added another 1.5 billion passwords, increasing the dataset by 15%.

Researchers warn that attackers can exploit the ten-billion-strong RockYou2024 compilation to target systems unprotected against brute-force attacks, contributing to widespread data breaches, financial fraud, and identity theft.

## Caution
Users should be aware of the severe risks associated with this leak. Reusing passwords greatly increases the likelihood of falling victim to credential stuffing attacks, where attackers use the leaked passwords to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
